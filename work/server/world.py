"""
World + player state for the PoGO private server, saved to disk.

MULTI-ACCOUNT: each username gets its own file in saves/<name>.json (bag, Pokemon,
XP, candy, storage...). The GYMS are deliberately SHARED in gyms.json, so two
accounts play in the same world and can see -- and battle -- each other's
defenders, the way the real game worked.

rpc.py calls use(username) at the top of every request. ThreadingHTTPServer gives
each request its own thread, so the "current player" is a thread-local and two
people playing at once never step on each other. Module-level names (world.BAG,
world.CANDY, ...) still work: a module __getattr__ forwards them to the player
whose request is being handled, so the rest of the server didn't have to change.
