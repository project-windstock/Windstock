settings.json -- the one file you edit by hand to tune how the game plays.

Written next to the .exe on first run, complete with a built-in explanation of
every value. Hot-reloaded by mtime, so saving the file applies within a few
seconds; no restart needed.

Precedence: environment variable > settings.json > built-in default. (The env
vars stayed supported so older shortcuts/batch files keep working.)

Things the World Manager UI owns -- placed stops/gyms (places.json) and the live
event (events.json) -- deliberately live elsewhere, so hand-edits here are never
