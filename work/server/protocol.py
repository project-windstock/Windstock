PoGO 0.29 RPC protocol: field-number map + message builders.

Field numbers/enum values are the canonical community POGOProtos values for
this era. They are kept as NAMED CONSTANTS in one place so that if the real
client's logged layout (see rpc.py request dumps) ever disagrees, it's a
one-line fix. The request side is parsed generically (pb.decode), so only the
RESPONSE builders below depend on these numbers being right.

    The tier comes from the RING size, so on its own it will happily hand out
    "Excellent" for a ball that clipped the edge of the Pokemon while the ring
    happened to be small. Gating on where the ball landed is what makes the
    bonus mean something.

    This client uses normalized_hit_position as a FLAG, not a continuous
    distance -- it is only ever 0.0 or 1.0:

        hitpos 1.0 = the ball landed INSIDE the ring   -> bonus is earned
        hitpos 0.0 = it missed the circle (and on an outright miss the field is
                     simply left at 0.0)               -> no bonus

    So the correct sense is center_is_one, and the gate is ON.

    This is the whole point of the gate, because the tier comes from the RING
    size: without it, holding for a tight ring and then throwing wide still pays
    "Excellent" for a ball that never went near the circle. Every one of the 8
    Excellents in the old logs was exactly that -- ring 1.70..1.88 with
    hitpos=0.0 -- while a real 1.79 landed in the circle scored nothing.

    Do NOT re-derive this sense from log statistics. Both wrong answers look
    plausible: include misses and the 0.0 bucket looks meaningless, and because
    landing a tiny circle is hard, in-circle throws (1.0) skew to LOOSER rings
    than the fake ones (0.0), which reads backwards. It was measured wrong twice
    that way. The ground truth is playing it: a wide throw at an excellent-sized
    ring must score nothing, and a ball in the circle must score.
      center_is_one  -> 1.0 is dead centre (bonus needs value >= tolerance)
      center_is_zero -> 0.0 is dead centre (bonus needs value <= 1 - tolerance)
