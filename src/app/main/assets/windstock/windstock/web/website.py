"""
The public Windstock website, served by the game server itself.

Why here rather than a separate static host: the status page has to fetch a health
endpoint, and a browser blocks that cross-origin unless the endpoint sends CORS
headers (the site's own README calls this out). Serving the pages from the same
origin the health check uses removes the problem entirely -- no CORS, no second
host to keep alive.

Routes (Caddy on windstock.playit.plus forwards exactly these to us):
    /                 -> index.html
    /index.html       -> the landing page
    /status.html      -> the status page
    /assets/*         -> css / js / images
    /api/health       -> JSON liveness for the status page

/api/health is deliberately NOT /health: on that domain /health already belongs to
headscale, and the status page must report whether the GAME server is up, not
whether the tailnet control plane is.
