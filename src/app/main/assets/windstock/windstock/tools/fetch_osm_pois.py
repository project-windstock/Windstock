"""
Pull real points-of-interest from OpenStreetMap and turn them into PokeStops/Gyms.

The server has no map data of its own, so procedural forts land wherever a cell
centre happens to fall -- including in the middle of roads. This fetches actual
businesses, shops, parks, churches, schools etc. around your play area from the
free OSM Overpass API and writes them as forts the server places verbatim. Because
they sit on real buildings, they are off the road and close enough to spin.

Usage (from server, or anywhere):
  py ../tools/fetch_osm_pois.py <lat> <lng> [radius_km]        # one area
  py ../tools/fetch_osm_pois.py 42.944 -102.236 3
Add more areas by running again with --append.

Writes data/osm_forts.json next to the server (the exe reads it there). Re-run any
time to refresh; without --append it replaces the file.
