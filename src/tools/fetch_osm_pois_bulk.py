"""
Bulk version of fetch_osm_pois: fill a whole area with real PokeStops/Gyms.

fetch_osm_pois.py grabs one radius in a single Overpass call, which is fine for a
few hundred forts but falls over past a couple thousand -- the public mirrors time
out or rate-limit a query that big. This walks the area as a grid of small tiles
instead, querying each one on its own and spiralling outward ring by ring from the
centre until it has collected up to <cap> real forts (default 10000) or runs out of
real businesses to find. Each tile is small enough that the mirrors answer happily.

Same output as fetch_osm_pois: writes data/osm_forts.json (the classify/dedup rules
and fort shape are imported from it, so both tools agree). pois.py hot-reloads it.

Usage (from server, or anywhere):
  py ../tools/fetch_osm_pois_bulk.py <lat> <lng>                  # up to 10000, <=25km
  py ../tools/fetch_osm_pois_bulk.py 40.758 -73.985 --cap 5000
  py ../tools/fetch_osm_pois_bulk.py 40.758 -73.985 --max-km 40 --append

10000 is a *ceiling*, not a promise: you only get that many if that many named
businesses actually exist within --max-km. A small town simply has fewer, and the
run stops early once it stops finding new ones. Re-run with --append to add another
city to the same file. Progress is saved after every ring, so a Ctrl-C keeps what
was collected so far.
