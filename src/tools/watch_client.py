"""
Watch the Pokemon GO client on the phone over adb and report whether it is
BUSY (grinding through the game master) or IDLE (genuinely hung).

The release client strips its own logs, so this is our only window into what it's
doing. Reads /proc/<pid>/stat fields 14/15 (utime/stime, in clock ticks) and
reports the CPU delta per sample.

  BUSY  -> it's applying the game master; leave it alone, it will finish + reboot.
  IDLE  -> it's waiting on something (us) or deadlocked; restarting won't help.

Usage:  py tools/watch_client.py [seconds_between_samples] [samples]
