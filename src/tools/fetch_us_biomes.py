"""
Build a whole-US real-terrain biome map, state by state.

biomes.py can tie spawns to real terrain from an osm_biomes.json, but the whole-US
extract's node cache won't fit on a small disk. So this walks the 50 states (+DC)
ONE AT A TIME: download the state's OSM extract, classify its water/forest/city/etc.
features into game biomes, vote the dominant biome into each level-12 S2 cell (~3km),
then delete the extract before moving on. The result is a compact {cell -> biome} map
that biomes.py looks up in O(1).

Resumable: progress is checkpointed after every state, so a crash or Ctrl-C picks up
where it left off. Writes data/osm_biomes.json (cells + any existing region points).

Usage (from server, or anywhere):
  py ../tools/fetch_us_biomes.py                 # all states
  py ../tools/fetch_us_biomes.py --only texas    # one state (repeatable)
